Most things are implemented as a Rust plugin if possible.

Always run tests and clippy after writing code to ensure it works.

Place all tests in the `tests/` directory.

Prefix commit messages with semantic releases conventions

We are in implementation phase.

Run `askds --system-prompt=../yek/prompts/implement.txt cat DESIGN.md` to get the next steps for the implementation.

IMPORTANT: to run the tests execute `askds --system-prompt=../yek/prompts/fix-tests.txt cargo test`
IMPORTANT: NEVER KILL ask.js too quickly while DeepSeek is reasoning

Once tests pass, commit your changes and run `askds --system-prompt=../yek/prompts/implement.txt cat DESIGN.md` to get the next steps for the implementation.
